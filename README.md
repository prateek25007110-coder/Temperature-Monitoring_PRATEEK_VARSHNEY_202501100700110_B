🌡️ Temperature Monitoring System

A simple and efficient Temperature Monitoring System built using a temperature sensor and microcontroller to continuously monitor environmental temperature in real-time. 
The system reads temperature data, processes it, and displays the output while triggering alerts when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.
